The development environment was mainly carried out on the local PC in the following environment.

> A : apache : httpd-2.4.51
> 
> P : php : php-7.4.25
> 
> M : MariaDB : 10.6.4

DB creates a table for the schema as follows.

```shell
CREATE TABLE `member` (
  `mem_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `firstname` varchar(50) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `lastname` varchar(50) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `username` varchar(30) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(12) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  `reg_date` varchar(14) COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`mem_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=3 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```

INSERT INTO `member` (`mem_id`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `username`, `password` , `reg_date`) VALUES
